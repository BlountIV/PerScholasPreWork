	<h2> More About Me</h2>

<p>Continuing from my hobbies and interests... 
	I'm learning Muay Thai martial arts. I learned a little bit of Capoeira years ago, but I'm rusty in that martial art. 
	I was learning Piano, but don't have the space to practice.
	I have 6 siblings, all brothers. I'm the second oldest on my mother's side and the oldest on my dad's side. I tend to go on spontaneous adventures by myself or meet up with my close friend to go on spontaneous adventures.</p>
